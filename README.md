# Course Registration

This project is created by using react.js. This is a sample webpage for purchasing online courses on various programming-based topics. There is a limited amount of credit hours which cannot be exceeded.

## Main Features
- **Responsive Design** - Course registration is made responsive for all the devices including phones, tablets, laptops and desktops.

- **Interactive Elements** - This website has many interactive features for selecting different courses in the course cart.

- **Brisk page rendering** - This project was created using React. As React creates virtual DOM, that's why it reloads and renders pages faster.

- **Use Of Conforming Images** - The images that were  used as the cover picture of each course were relevant.

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility** - This website is tested in multiple browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc.

## How the states are managed in this project?

The states that are used in this project are handled by prop drilling.

In React, when we have lots of different components working together, sometimes we need to send information from one part to another. Prop drilling is like passing a note in class â€“ we give a message to our friend, and they pass it to their friend until it reaches the right person.

This helps keep things organized because each part only knows about the parts directly connected to it. But, if we have too many messages going back and forth, it can get messy and complicated.

So, prop drilling is a handy way to share information between parts in React, but if things get too complicated, there are other tricks to make it easier such as Context API.
